This project showcases an AVL Tree

Fleet is a AVL tree where you can add nodes called ships to build a fleet. 
You can add nodes, delete nodes, search for nodes by ship ID and clear the whole tree.

This prject showcases the most important aspect of an AVL tree in that it balances itself after every insertion or deletion.
This way all insert, delete and search operations on the tree perform in O(log(n)).

Included is a test file (mytest.cpp) that tests all the operations of the data structure to make sure that they all perform in
O(log(n)) time and that no memory is leaked.

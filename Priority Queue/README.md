This project showcases a priority queue in the form of both a minheap and maxheap

Fleet is a AVL tree where you can add nodes called ships to build a fleet. 
You can add nodes, delete nodes, search for nodes by ship ID and clear the whole tree.

This project showcases the most important aspect of a queue in that it uses a merge queue funciton to maintain the principles of the data structure, ensuring that all operations perform in O(log(n)). In this project the user can also switch between a minheap and a maxheap and the data structure will reorganize itself in O(log(n)) time while ensuring that no data is lost.

Included is a test file (mytest.cpp) that tests all the operations of the data structure to make sure that they all perform in
O(log(n)) time and that no memory is leaked.
